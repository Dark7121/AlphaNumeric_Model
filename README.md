# Final_Year_Model
Project.py is main file from where I created my model and saved it and Project_phase_2.py is the file where I can manually select a picture from file manager or upload it and model can recognise it.
GUI, GUI2, GUI3 these 3 files I made separately but none of them worked properly.
my_model.keras is model I made and trained with the dataset.
