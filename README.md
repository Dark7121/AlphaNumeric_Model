# Final_Year_Model
Project.py is main file from where I created my model and saved it and Project_phase_2.py is the file where I can manually select a picture from file manager or upload it and model can recognise it.
GUI, GUI2, GUI3 these 3 files I made to use them as UI for this system.
my_model.keras is model I saved after I trained with the dataset.
